I run back and forth to the satin then the trash, back and forth and back and forth. But in the middle of the piece of satin is a woman.

When we got to Joey's house, we noticed that we were wearing our ugly My school sweats and T shirts (which are from our school that we have to wear every morning and on trips sometimes - when Arlie and I went on a school \"midyear retreat\" and we had to wear our school clothes it was really embarrassing). This is especially embarrassing but we realized it didn't matter because Joey wasn't there. Also, I forgot earlier, there were two fine guys walking around who we saw and briefly talked to. I don't remember what we said.",

My grandma told me she would be delighted to take me to the bathroom. The bathroom is all set up like a stable and I go in one of the stalls. Then my grandma said she had to leave and I was going to have to walk alone with this lady. When I get into the stall, it's not a stall. There's a rodeo going on.

I was in a jumper outfit (I hate jumpers) and I had this huge ball which I kept throwing in the air and I would go after it and fall over (I was a klutz). Then my sister came along and we skipped around. Then I was at this hotel in the woods and I walk around the side and it looks like our patio, except enlarged. There's a bench overlooking a creek. There's a full moon and my swim coach is on the bench whistling (he always whistles). That's all I remember.",

He had left his window open and a weird guy (a person I don't know) jumped through the window and tried to steal the car. But I jumped through the car window and landed in the front passenger's side. I tried to stop him but he kept going. Then I managed to take the keys. I turned around the car and and to the weird guy's home. Then I drove to my crushes house and parked the car.

Then we both got into bed (the same bed), and cuddled, like he might do with someone his age, and I am unclear if anything sexual happened after that, but if it did I remember he didn't think it was a big deal, and I was worried about what other people would think. But he made me feel relaxed. My brother was in the dream at the end.",
"I drove in my friend Chloe's car and her mom dropped us off on some unrecognizable road. Chloe, another friend, and I played on the street for a while, then rollerbladed (or maybe ice skated) to like a movie theater/bar/disco. The movie playing was a horror movie. As I left walked through the bar into the disco. Chloe and Robin eventually joined me, then Chloe's mom picked us up again, and dropped us off at the road we'd started on. We then discovered that one of the houses on the block belonged to our principal. Then we stole a bottle of Peach Nectarine sparkling juice that was outside his house, drank most of it...I can't remember past there...",
"Most of the dream I can't remember. I think I had been on a camping trip, and on the way back we stopped in something like the Star Dome; I lifted up the flap of this big rubber star shaped thing, and inside I saw what I thought were three bats. When I got out, I think I remember being back on the camping trip, in a place similar to a camp site we stayed aton a camping trip I took with my dad. Now, everything after that is a blur, but I seem to remember some man (who I think represented my father, though didn't look quite like him) being shot, and as some police man dragged him off he handed me a strawberry smoothie. I also remember meeting with the 7-8th girls, but I don't know where or why.",
"All I remember is being a caterpillar (I think I was male, because I remember coming \"home from work\" and finding my wife already there). We were in a cherry tree. The first dream I can only remember hugging a fairly young boy, and his two older brothers saying something along the lines of \"Don't become too attached.\" The dream after (before the caterpillars) I as in the Nature Company store, or maybe a science museum gift shop.",
"I dreamt I was lying in the snow in Alaska and was having seizures and nobody was coming to help me. That's because I realized in my dream that I was actually in my bed. In my dream, I was dreaming. (In real life, when I woke up, I found I had a fever of 102 degrees and was chilled. I was having violent convulsions and my throat was dry from coughing. My head was bleeding because I hit my head on the bedside table during one of my convulsions. Nobody had come to help me.)",
"I was lying on my bed in my room, but everything in my room was on fire. I couldn't get my covers off me and my vision started to blur. I saw my great-grandmother coming through the fire to get to me and take me up to Heaven with her. I walked to the door where she was. Then I was whizzing through a tunnel with her while a golden light was pulling us on. I loved it. (Real: when I woke up my mom was shaking me and she said that I hadn't been breathing and she couldn't find a pulse on me.)",
"I had just spent the night over at my best friend's house and we were waking up on a gorgeous spring morning. She had to go to school, but I didn't, so I wanted to go with her. She lives less than a block away from her school, and I was jealous that she could wake up at 7:30 and make it to school by 8. I was shaving my legs with her electric razor and then we went into her back yard and went swimming in the cool water.",
"It was like watching a cartoon show. There was this guy and he left home &amp; met a girl, but she didn't like him all that much. He was pretty stupid. Back home his little sis (about 5 years old) &amp; his parents are watching a movie. The parents were sitting on her to keep her quiet. All I saw was their butts and her head &amp; shoulders. She was squirming and when she finally got her head out she yelled something like \"(brother's name) got out of the house and is running around with a girl!\" Then back to the girl &amp; guy. They suddenly had a fat guy friend with them. They did some stuff, but all I remember is a scene with the guy on a pay phone in a hotel with the other two standing around. The girl got mad and walked away. The guy dropped the phone and followed. There was more but I don't remember it.",
"I was going to fence someone but all of the swords didn't have long blades. I asked some buy to fence and he turned out to be my friend's brother. We were talking and he told me he was taking calculus XZ. Then he smiled at me and I think I liked him. He said two nice things to me and said something about the difference in our age. Then he said, \"You aren't using my sister to get to me?\" I said no and he said, \"I don't want my sister to get hurt.\" Before that, we were at camp and assigned to jobs before the feast. I went downstairs to this beach; someone was telling me about how people died in a volcano here. It reminded me of Mt. Vesuvius. Then me &amp; Jeanette went down a dark road in a car to go grocery shopping even though it wasn't my job. Then I went down stairs to the boys school where my old crush R. went to school. I was looking for him but I couldn't find him.",
"I went to school and we were doing Drama. Steve asked me, Melissa and Liz to sing in front of everybody. I don't like sitting in front of people so I sort of mouthed it: Then Steve, the Director, said Great! Liz, you're cast as Juliet, Melissa, you're cast as Lady Capulet, and Kelly, you're cast as the nurse. I felt cheated. I cried and said \"I never even auditioned for the parts.\" Steve said that Melissa could sing the song in the play. I didn't even want the part of the nurse. I wanted Juliet.",
"We went to a restaurant like we always do on Sundays with my parents. Then Mrs. H. came up to me and told me and Courtney that I needed to get measured for the wedding. She said Alessandra, Monique de Brian would measure us. Monique had this weird measuring device like a stick that she put over Courtney's chest. Then Monique was hitting a ball with a piece of metal from her sword. I tried doing that by throwing it but I couldn't. Then Saul made me bend my knees and make sure my arm was above my lets. Then I threw the rock really far into a pile of rocks. Then I was walking down a big mossy step to this guy I knew from somewhere. Then I talked with Courtney and Melissa about my school. I was visiting there and Linda came up to me. I had to tell R. than you for something. Then Courtney said that she didn't want to go to my school because the female admissions director had been mean to her. Then the scene played again, and I saw what happened: It was strange. The I went to Burlingame Avenue with 2 people from my school, and went into a gourmet food store that sold Margaritas. The other stores didn't, even though they had displays up telling people they did. Then the crackers started bouncing up and down in a strange order. I wanted the garlic and cheese ones. Monique said she had been fencing since she was 3, then 2 1/2. While she was measuring me, Jacob, and Patty, his wife, gave us a (illegible) about something confusing but it was supposed to be about love.",
"I was in Northern British Columbia and I was walking down a street. At the end of the street was a beautiful lake. I was wearing goggles and I found that I couldn't see very well without them off. I went into a drug store but I could buy anything. I realized this was where I wanted to live. My friends were making snowballs near the lake. They were wearing ski clothes.",
"I was at My school but it didn't look like My school. Stuff happened that I can't remember. The me and a few other friends went to the classroom next to where were sleeping. It looked like classroom 2 at school, but had more stuff in it. My friend A. said that tequila tastes good with tortillas. I didn't find this at all strange. So we go into the classroom and ask if there are any tortillas. They say no but that there is pita bread, so we go in there and everyone else disappears. We look under the sink, which isn't in classroom 2 really, and underneath are big jugs (those square kind that cleaning stuff comes in) and they are kind of see-through and there is yellow-whitish liquid inside. On them they say something I don't remember. Anyway we pour the tequila into margarita glasses and eat it with pita bread. Some stuff happens. (I think that it has gotten later but I'm not sure.) An elderly black man comes in and says he has to check us. We immediately think he's talking about us drinking tequila. I'm the type who would break down and tell everything we were doing. I look, about to laugh at this black girl to my right (A.'s on my left). She put her long dark red nails in her mouth (a normal gesture as if biting her nails), and leans her head down and tells me no (don't tell). The man goes and checks behind a mirror inside a mirror like the illustration. Behind, there are some photos. Inside were the photos that showed the snake that bit one of the teachers. This was a big mystery, solved. Then we went away. I think later there was a big commotion with the teacher who had been bit.",
"I was with my family. We went to buy something at a store and I found this CD I kind of wanted so I put it in a bag. Then I tried on these ugly rainbow-colored shoes. I put these in a bag.

Then we see some black gangsters fighting and my mom sighs, \"please don't start.\" Then they start punching people out and Tupac gets rolled in front of our car &amp; starts screaming something at us.",
"I forget most except that these 2 guys get in a fight. The one who wins is saying \"Would you do this to me?\" The other guy just laughs. The guy who wins says, \"Well, then suck this.\" He puts his penis all over the other guy's mouth. Later they are walking on rocky hills and the guy who lost is wiping his mouth with a towel and saying \"Aw, that's disgusting.\"",
"I was in a classroom with the rest of my class (8th grade). Steve, our teacher and principal, was calling up, one by one, the people with long hair and cutting their hair so that it was about jawbone length. I was the last person to be called up. I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room.

We had to choose the one to go. We chose Emily because she didn't hear us. Someone gave her an Orio and said he wanted to record exactly how she ate it. She willingly took one cookie and described it as she went along. She pulled it apart and said she had to lick the cream filling first, and then she ate the outside.

"Remember loose bear. My class was having a party in the same building they film either Star Wars or Star Trek, and we were going to sleep over. Our photography teacher was there and when the rest of the class was off doing something, I talked with Jan and he basically told me that he was homeless. After I talked with him I went to find a place to sleep. I went up to the loft and I saw Diana holding on to the top of her rolled up sleeping bag when it was vertical. Then it just fell over and I thought she could only do that because it was her birthday. I decided not to sleep in the loft because I would be so separated. There was a bear chained down in a room and after I looked in the loft, I looked under the wall to bear's room and I saw a bear foot chained down. I poked my head all the way through and the bear was gone. Steve was with me and picked up a rifle and I told him not to and he just scoffed at me. I picked up a rifle, then said, \"OK, fine.\" I also picked up a handgun and ran out shouting that there was a loose bear. I ran into the room and they were filming Star _____ and shouted the warning and everyone panicked. I said, \"Use only tranquilizer darts.\" Steve said, \"Yeah, right.\"",
"When it started we were at some sort of party. All the kids from my class were there, although I didn't see them all. I just knew they were there. All the teachers were there too. I can't remember what went on for a while, but then Steve told Melissa to share what happened to her. She said, \"No, that's all right. I don't really have to.\" Steve and Todd told her she had to. So she told everyone she passed her math exam and everyone applauded. The somehow it was Nina who had told the news, and tears came to her eyes and she went running to the bathroom, and Courtney and I followed. When we got there, she had locked herself in the stall. I said, \"Nina, why are you crying? You passed your math exam!\" And she said, \"Get away from me, you fat, ugly bitch.\" Anne had also come in the bathroom in time to hear this, and she walked to the stall, unlocked it, and went in. Then Julia went in too. I don't remember what happened, but a lot of the 7th graders came in, including Anna. For some reason we were throwing a tomato around the room and it bounced off Anna's shoulder. She was worried that she'd smashed it, but Nina said, \"Don't worry, you're not fat like Hilary.\" I can't remember what happened after that. I think I woke up, but the dream continued for a minute, then changed.",
"I don't remember what was happening in the beginning, but then all the 8th grade girls were going to one room and all the 8th grade guys were going to another room. I went out of the room, went outside at the bottom of a hill, and Julia came down too because there wasn't enough room where all the girls were. Somehow there was a round table set up out there, so we were writing on it. Then Evan called out a window, \"Do you think we could bring that table up here?\" I told him we could take it down, then roll it on the flat areas, but there was no way we could get it up the stairs. I don't remember what happened after that, I just know that Julia and I were having a great time.",
"I'm not sure how it started, but somehow I had been kidnapped. My kidnapper was a man. We were on the street and he said we needed to punch it out, except he taught me how to punch. Then we were walking down the street and I wanted to go home, so he said okay. Except he had to go soon. I saw a white Explorer, so I went to check the license plate but it wasn't ours. So we continued on. He said he would drive me home but he had no room in his car. (How weird an offer is that from a kidnapper?) Then on the street there was a Marriott or some hotel. So I walked inside to phone my parents, and it was a classroom. So I said, \"Mom, I have to ask you a question.\" But then my mom woke me up.",
"I don't remember any details about this dream. I just know they were going to draft 7 women in the army (Vietnam war) and they went down the line of women and said, \"Do you want to fight for your country?\" I wasn't in the dream. It was like I was watching it happen.",
"I was sledding on a hill that was covered with a thick forest. First, I was sledding from the top to the bottom, but I soon was only going halfway up. When I started only going halfway up, the snow started tomelt.",
"I was on the hill and a lady called me to come to a building. The place felt like camp. A whole bunch of people went to the building. There was a lady there telling all the kids where they could go and then she dismissed them. I stayed in the building and tried to talk to a boy. There were some people next to the door at a table talking. I also saw a project that I had been working on at home. I also saw the same boy drawing a large landscape.",
"I left the building and went to the kitchen area of the camp. My older sister was there and she introduced me to the other kitchen staff. She also showed me a picture of the kitchen staff. There were some ghosts in it and then my sister tried to introduce me to air. Then the kitchen made me be in a team go-cart race. My little sister was on my team. We fought over the go-cart we got. I got a go-cart away from the rest of my team. We were doing fine and I as in the lead when all of a sudden I went down a hill and the track forked. I took the right path and it went down a steep hill and entered a room, but there seemed to be no way out but a staircase. So I climbed the staircase and went along the track. I was having a great time and I was sure I won when I got to the finish line ahead of everybody else. Then the referee said that I was disqualified because I didn't have my go cart. I looked down and he was right. I had left it at the bottom of the stairs. I had thought I was still in it. Soon the rest of the go-carts came in.",
"I hardly remember anything so I'll just write about the bits I do remember. I remember looking for something and going up a hill to look for it and sliding back down it and slamming into a wall. I remember many houses along a street and the kids in the houses were falling in love with each other and sneaking through woods to see each other. I also remember a man who had been tricked into getting really mad, and while the town was in a circle having some kind of meeting, he lassoed them. And then he was never forgiven what he did. I think the person who tricked him was a woman. Soon the dream made more sense. I was racing through the woods with my younger sister and a whole bunch of other kids. Suddenly, I started moving my legs weirdly and I started to fly. Soon I had a balloon in one hand, my sister's hand in the other, two books under my arms, and I was flying above the treetops. I did not win the race but I did learn how to fly. When I got there, there was an adult who was surprised that I could lift off the ground with only two balloons (my sister was holding one). I also remember a poor family that lived in a big house that came from a warmer north.",
"I was talking to Katie on the phone and suddenly realized that I had pictures of both Glenn and Chloe. She was excited and wanted to come over.",

"I was cleaning my room and found a card covered in inches of lint and dust. When I blew on it, it flew up and clogged up my nose.",
"I had just finished swim practice and I was going to get a ride home with my friend but the car was full so I biked home. I had done it many times before but at this one street I couldn't remember which way to go. I would choose one way, ride on it for a while, then turn back when I realized it wouldn't take me home. Then there was this bell all over the city, like a school bell, which said summer vacation had started. Suddenly everyone was gone on vacation and I was still lost.",
"I was skiing with my friend Chloe's older brother, and we were going to meet her at the bottom of the mountain to leave. We decided we just had to go up one more lift to ski down. When we got to the top he wanted to eat, but I didn't want to be late meeting my friend. I got mad and he stayed to eat, and I went down the hill.",
"I was a dog and I was running around in someone's backyard for a while. Then this guy came out (I was with my two other dog friends) and started chasing us. My two friends ran out the door in the fence, but he closed it and I snuck out under the fence. Then the whole dream started over again and I didn't get out, but my friends did and I got mad. I had to go scrub walls as a punishment.",
"I was in a swimming pool with Julia and Erin, and there was dirt on the ground of the pool, so when you swam across the middle you weren't allowed to put your feet on the ground. These guys were diving for a lid to a drink, and they had to pick it up with their mouths. Suddenly, my drama teacher was there and she made us turn around and not look as they dived for it so as not to embarrass them or something. That's what she does in the dance class during exams, when we have to make up a dance she makes everyone turn around so the person won't be embarrassed.",
"I was at swim practice. My whole class was there. We all changed and went outside and got in the pool and started swimming. The pool was much larger than usual, and about 40 feet deep. I heard that my friend Louis was walking through the building, so I wanted to see him and I got out as soon as I could, but he had left when I got outside.",
"I was an Indian on a reservation but it was also a ski resort. All day we went up and down the mountain. There was a border which was marking white man's land. There was a bathroom right across it. I really had to go so I did. Because I trespassed I started this whole war, and the whites started invading and attacking us. It was cold, and I managed to get a fire started to keep warm, and all the Indians were huddled around it while the whites moved closer and closer in on us.",
"I was on a cruise and it was summer. A waiter, Brandon, always brought me ice cream. Suddenly everybody started getting sick and dying, so I decided to leave the boat before I died. I swam for a long time, and I got to this island with nothing but fruit trees. I lived there for a while, but I was lonely although I was otherwise happy. Then a rescue plane came and took me home.",
"I was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, and the Witch was chasing me around this pillar inside the castle. We kept going around and around for the longest time, but it was never repetitive at all. She never caught me.",
"I was having a birthday party and my friends started to arrive at my house. But before I knew it there were hundreds of people in my house who I didn't know. I was trying to get them to leave, but it was so crazy and there were just too many of them. My mom was going insane because the house was getting trashed, but my friends weren't helping, they were just partying away.",
"I was sleeping over at my friend's house, and we were having a great time. I took a shower and used their shampoo, when I got my friend's brother started screaming how the shampoo cost hundreds of dollars and he was going to kill me. I got scared and started to run because he was coming after me with an axe. My friend was trying to calm him down, it was just a big chase scene, and the whole time all I had on was a towel.",
"I was a Carebear from the show \"Carebears\" and my Carebear friends and I were riding around on rainbows and having a good time. Suddenly the leader of the carebears got really mad at me for no reason and told me I was banished. I hadn't done anything, so I didn't leave. When he found out, he was going to put me in jail, but I got away before he could.",
"I had a younger sister who ran away. I had to go look at shirts she had worn to guess what she was wearing, and finally concluded that she was at a middle school I used to attend.",
"My cousin's friend was over who I'd never met but always wanted to meet. When I saw Michael's friend I couldn't believe it 'cause he was tall and fine and looked about 14! (I'm 13.) I kept asking him and Michael \"are you really only 9 years old?\" and he would answer yes! That's all I remember.",
"I was trying to see if I could make a compost pile with a pile of old clothes, and this big yellow bug started flying after me. And then my alarm went off. I woke up and went back to sleep (in my dream).",
"All I remember is the end of the dream: I was at a typical My school party, out on one of our many lawns, eating little sandwiches, and little cookies, and drinking tea, on a fairly cheerful Sunday afternoon. Then I went home and started making myself a brownie (just one) when my mom started asking me questions about a guy she thought I liked.",
"I was doing a play, and we did lots of improv work. I think it was a school play, though it seemed like an acting camp I went to over the summer. Then we were doing the play, and the music was all off, so we had to improvise in front of the audience. Then I was really made at Olive (who happens to be my worst enemy), so I called her a bitch and then I woke up.",
"Me and my brother Max were swimming in the ocean. I jumped off a cliff to join him, and we decided we'd stay there overnight. So then we had to go to higher ground, and we hiked up a bunch of hills as the sun was setting (it was really pretty), then found a cabin we could stay in, that nobody else was using. Then my parents stopped by to make sure everything was okay, and that I had taken my contacts out.",
"I went to summer camp, met a girl who liked my straightforwardness, and she gave me some false eyelashes. I remember thinking I'd forgotten all my hair products. Then I saw a little boy being beat up, so I went over to one of the guys and told him he was a fuck-up. He then asked me if I wanted my head twisted off, and got really pissed. So I told him he had misunderstood my comment, and what I really said was \"I wanna fuck you up.\" So he changed his mind and fell in love with me, and we did this dancing-flying kind of thing. After we did this, I accidentally let go and flew into another room, and changed into a twin of the man in there. Then there was something in there about Dorothy/Judy Garland, but I don't remember. I don't remember the ending.",
"All I an remember is going through a house then into a garden maze. It turned out to be one of those \"group\" skills activities, but it took me a while to find my group. They had found many clues already, so I wasn't that helpful. I think we won.",
"The first part of the dream I was with a bunch of friends and we felt like doing something stupid and rebellious, but we figured we'd better have my other friend Sally along. Since nobody else knew the way to her house, I drove. Eventually we just sat around talking, eating cookies, and making scrap-books in the middle of the night, up in Sally's loft. I had some mini-dream about being in a computer game. Me and my family and family friends went to this Club Med, and they were all a part of the Club Med circus team, and they wanted me to do the trapeze. I'm an acrophobic, so they couldn't get me to do it. Right at the end of my dreams, Whitney Houston sang \"I will always love you.\"",

"I remember hardly nothing about this dream. I just know that there was Liz, Laura, Anne, Will, Jeannette, Anna and I, and we were trying to figure out a math problem, but we looked at the time and said, \"We'll never have enough time to figure it out!\"",
"We were having some sort of Wee Care drive. We were collecting clothes, except people would come by, take off their clothes, throw them in the collection pile, and walk off. That's all I remember.",
"It was a really windy night. The wind blew my back door open. My cat got outside. (Once outside, she gets scared of people.) I went out into the backyard to call for her, but it was really windy and whenever I would call for her the wind would carry my voice away. Then she was sitting on the garden gate laughing at me, and I couldn't move towards her because the wind was too strong.",
"It was the day of Laura's surprise party, but it was during school. Nina and I didn't go to school, so we set up the room, and Laura was supposed to come between 12:15 and 12:45 so everyone came, and we were sitting around waiting for Laura to come. She didn't come, and it was 1:00, so I went someplace to wait for her. 1:30, and she wasn't coming. So I phoned school, and Emily answered. She said, \"Hilary, are you coming to school?\" and I said, \"No.\" Then I asked, \"Has Laura left yet?\" and she said, \"She left 19 minutes ago.\" So I went back to the party room and I don't remember anything after that.",
"I was walking down an alley when I came to a corner onto a big street. On the corner inside a big door a girl and boy were making a mattress. The girl hated me but the boy was my friend and he came out to talk with me. Then he held a model helicopter above his head and started to fly, so I followed him. Then we sat on a ridge coming out of a building. He said he could fly like me now but not without the helicopter. All of a sudden the ridge we were on broke, and we fell. Then further down the street I saw a lady in a business suit coming towards us. I started to run, but she was able to catch me. I tried to get away by flying but she was holding onto me so tight I could hardly get off the ground. Then she took me to a store that reminded me of Korea. Then she said I could have anything I wanted but I refused. Then the people from the north came by and got me away from the lady and took me skiing in some odd apparel.",
"I was walking through a jail when I came to a room where everybody was wearing bikinis. One weirdo said that soon the whole world would be wearing bikinis. The I left and went though a thin hallway that had barred windows in it, with people's hands reaching out and touching me. Then I came to a room filled with weird people. I even saw a rat person come out from under the table. The owner of the place took him away. Then I became friends with the owner and he told me that some people were coming to look at the prison soon. He asked me my opinion of the place. I suggested that he doesn't let them go through the hallway with the hands. So we built another hallway with nothing in it.",

She beckons him behind a tree into a garden; he is confused. She takes two willow branches off a tree and I get the feeling she is about to start the Klingon mating ritual. The next thing I know I am in a bedroom. The son is in a bed with his grandma (I guess there wasn't enough room). Be'lanna was standing next to the bed. Also the whole alien delegation is in there and everyone is wearing ceremonial robes, even Be'lanna and the people in bed. Then either Be'lanna or the son said to each other they had a lot of fun last night. The leaders looked very disapproving and the guards started to spin their spears.",

My friend Gia was there and she was in a green skating dress. Linda tried to describe how Gia was skating a special part in our show. Then she asked who Evita was and then she explained who she was.
