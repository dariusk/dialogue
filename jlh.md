She willingly took one cookie and described it as she went along. She pulled it apart and said she had to lick the cream filling first, and then she ate the outside. Immediately after eating it, she looked at her arm and it started to turn green with red splotches, just like the aliens. She was pretty angry at us for tricking her.

"Remember loose bear. My class was having a party in the same building they film either Star Wars or Star Trek, and we were going to sleep over. Our photography teacher was there and when the rest of the class was off doing something, I talked with Jan and he basically told me that he was homeless. After I talked with him I went to find a place to sleep. I went up to the loft and I saw Diana holding on to the top of her rolled up sleeping bag when it was vertical. Then it just fell over and I thought she could only do that because it was her birthday. I decided not to sleep in the loft because I would be so separated. There was a bear chained down in a room and after I looked in the loft, I looked under the wall to bear's room and I saw a bear foot chained down. I poked my head all the way through and the bear was gone. Steve was with me and picked up a rifle and I told him not to and he just scoffed at me. I picked up a rifle, then said, "OK, fine." I also picked up a handgun and ran out shouting that there was a loose bear. I ran into the room and they were filming Star _____ and shouted the warning and everyone panicked. I said, "Use only tranquilizer darts." Steve said, "Yeah, right.""

Then I saw a little boy being beat up, so I went over to one of the guys and told him he was a fuck-up. He then asked me if I wanted my head twisted off, and got really pissed. So I told him he had misunderstood my comment, and what I really said was "I wanna fuck you up." So he changed his mind and fell in love with me, and we did this dancing-flying kind of thing. After we did this, I accidentally let go and flew into another room, and changed into a twin of the man in there. Then there was something in there about Dorothy/Judy Garland, but I don't remember.

"I'm not sure how it started, but somehow I had been kidnapped. My kidnapper was a man. We were on the street and he said we needed to punch it out, except he taught me how to punch. Then we were walking down the street and I wanted to go home, so he said okay. Except he had to go soon. I saw a white Explorer, so I went to check the license plate but it wasn't ours. So we continued on. He said he would drive me home but he had no room in his car. (How weird an offer is that from a kidnapper?) Then on the street there was a Marriott or some hotel. So I walked inside to phone my parents, and it was a classroom. So I said, "Mom, I have to ask you a question." But then my mom woke me up."

"I was at my friend Arlie's house and her mom suggested that we take their dog for a walk. I know that Joey lived down the street and we might see him. So I convinced her to go with me. We were heading out the door with her dog, when all of a sudden these grownups (maybe friends of her parents) showed up and Arlie's parents and them decided to come with us. We were trying to get away from them so we wouldn't be seen together. Finally, all the adults except one who had a little two year old girl. When we got to Joey's house, we noticed that we were wearing our ugly My school sweats and T shirts (which are from our school that we have to wear every morning and on trips sometimes - when Arlie and I went on a school "midyear retreat" and we had to wear our school clothes it was really embarrassing). This is especially embarrassing but we realized it didn't matter because Joey wasn't there. Also, I forgot earlier, there were two fine guys walking around who we saw and briefly talked to. I don't remember what we said."

"Wow, check out that juicer," she said to no one in particular. She was hoping it would distract her, if for some brief moment, from her life.
She thought about school, and how A Non-Hewitt and The One Who Is Not JLH were such total bitches. Did they secretly like her after all? It didn't matter anyway. They walked around the school like they owned the place. They never invited her to parties; it was a fluke she ended up at this one. 


She Who Lacks The Grace of JLH entered the back yard.
She dutifully avoided the lawn furniture out of some primal respect for its otherness. She wished the booze would kick in.

"I was walking down an alley when I came to a corner onto a big street. On the corner inside a big door a girl and boy were making a mattress. The girl hated me but the boy was my friend and he came out to talk with me. Then he held a model helicopter above his head and started to fly, so I followed him. Then we sat on a ridge coming out of a building. He said he could fly like me now but not without the helicopter. All of a sudden the ridge we were on broke, and we fell. Then further down the street I saw a lady in a business suit coming towards us. I started to run, but she was able to catch me. I tried to get away by flying but she was holding onto me so tight I could hardly get off the ground. Then she took me to a store that reminded me of Korea. Then she said I could have anything I wanted but I refused. Then the people from the north came by and got me away from the lady and took me skiing in some odd apparel."

"When it started we were at some sort of party. All the kids from my class were there, although I didn't see them all. I just knew they were there. All the teachers were there too. I can't remember what went on for a while, but then Steve told Melissa to share what happened to her. She said, "No, that's all right. I don't really have to." Steve and Todd told her she had to. So she told everyone she passed her math exam and everyone applauded. The somehow it was Nina who had told the news, and tears came to her eyes and she went running to the bathroom, and Courtney and I followed. When we got there, she had locked herself in the stall. I said, "Nina, why are you crying? You passed your math exam!" And she said, "Get away from me, you fat, ugly bitch." Anne had also come in the bathroom in time to hear this, and she walked to the stall, unlocked it, and went in. Then Julia went in too. I don't remember what happened, but a lot of the 7th graders came in, including Anna. For some reason we were throwing a tomato around the room and it bounced off Anna's shoulder. She was worried that she'd smashed it, but Nina said, "Don't worry, you're not fat like Hilary." I can't remember what happened after that. I think I woke up, but the dream continued for a minute, then changed."

"I was in a classroom with the rest of my class (8th grade). Steve, our teacher and principal, was calling up, one by one, the people with long hair and cutting their hair so that it was about jawbone length. I was the last person to be called up. I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room. My hair was just below shoulder length. I wondered for about 20 seconds about why he had cut it shorter. I figured I just didn't see where Steve cut my hair. Then I noticed that my hair looked good at this length and looked at the mirror for a while."

We were trying to get away from them so we wouldn't be seen together. Finally, all the adults except one who had a little two year old girl.

I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room. My hair was just below shoulder length. I wondered for about 20 seconds about why he had cut it shorter. I figured I just didn't see where Steve cut my hair.

"When it started we were at some sort of party. All the kids from my class were there, although I didn't see them all. I just knew they were there. All the teachers were there too. I can't remember what went on for a while, but then Steve told Melissa to share what happened to her. She said, "No, that's all right. I don't really have to." Steve and Todd told her she had to. So she told everyone she passed her math exam and everyone applauded. The somehow it was Nina who had told the news, and tears came to her eyes and she went running to the bathroom, and Courtney and I followed. When we got there, she had locked herself in the stall. I said, "Nina, why are you crying? You passed your math exam!" And she said, "Get away from me, you fat, ugly bitch." Anne had also come in the bathroom in time to hear this, and she walked to the stall, unlocked it, and went in. Then Julia went in too. I don't remember what happened, but a lot of the 7th graders came in, including Anna. For some reason we were throwing a tomato around the room and it bounced off Anna's shoulder. She was worried that she'd smashed it, but Nina said, "Don't worry, you're not fat like Hilary." I can't remember what happened after that. I think I woke up, but the dream continued for a minute, then changed."


Jennifer Love Hewitt entered the foyer.
She stared at the chandelier uncomprehendingly. She was hoping it would distract her, if for some brief moment, from her life.


After some time, She Who Lacks The Grace of JLH found herself in the breakfast nook.
The juicer caught her eye. She thought it was the ugliest thing she'd ever seen. Things. The house was full of things. When she got old enough to have a house, she'd own nothing.
She thought about school, and how A Non-Hewitt and Not Even a Celebrity thought they were so much better than everyone else. Why did they leave whenever she entered a room? Were they jealous of her somehow? Not likely. They were always laughing with their perfect friends. They walked around the school like they owned the place. They always got they wanted. Always. Did they suspect she thought about them so much?

"I was at a mall and there was a group of kids. One girl and a bunch of guys surrounding her. I was in a jumper outfit (I hate jumpers) and I had this huge ball which I kept throwing in the air and I would go after it and fall over (I was a klutz). Then my sister came along and we skipped around. Then I was at this hotel in the woods and I walk around the side and it looks like our patio, except enlarged. There's a bench overlooking a creek. There's a full moon and my swim coach is on the bench whistling (he always whistles). That's all I remember."

"Jennifer Love Hewitt, what did you dream about last night?" asked A Non-Hewitt. Jennifer Love Hewitt seemed wary, but her face softened.
"I was sitting in a restaurant when three men came in and started robbing the place. Everyone screamed and they shot one person. They lay on the floor, blood streaming out of them. I stood there and I didn't know what to do, so I started screaming and they tried to shoot me but bullets bounced off, and they were unarmed. People came and held them until the police came."

Then Monique was hitting a ball with a piece of metal from her sword. I tried doing that by throwing it but I couldn't. Then Saul made me bend my knees and make sure my arm was above my lets. Then I threw the rock really far into a pile of rocks. Then I was walking down a big mossy step to this guy I knew from somewhere. Then I talked with Courtney and Melissa about my school. I was visiting there and Linda came up to me. I had to tell R. than you for something. Then Courtney said that she didn't want to go to my school because the female admissions director had been mean to her. Then the scene played again, and I saw what happened: It was strange. The I went to Burlingame Avenue with 2 people from my school, and went into a gourmet food store that sold Margaritas. The other stores didn't, even though they had displays up telling people they did. Then the crackers started bouncing up and down in a strange order. I wanted the garlic and cheese ones. Monique said she had been fencing since she was 3, then 2 1/2.

"We went to a restaurant like we always do on Sundays with my parents. Then Mrs. H. came up to me and told me and Courtney that I needed to get measured for the wedding. She said Alessandra, Monique de Brian would measure us. Monique had this weird measuring device like a stick that she put over Courtney's chest. Then Monique was hitting a ball with a piece of metal from her sword. I tried doing that by throwing it but I couldn't. Then Saul made me bend my knees and make sure my arm was above my lets. Then I threw the rock really far into a pile of rocks. Then I was walking down a big mossy step to this guy I knew from somewhere. Then I talked with Courtney and Melissa about my school. I was visiting there and Linda came up to me. I had to tell R. than you for something. Then Courtney said that she didn't want to go to my school because the female admissions director had been mean to her. Then the scene played again, and I saw what happened: It was strange. The I went to Burlingame Avenue with 2 people from my school, and went into a gourmet food store that sold Margaritas. The other stores didn't, even though they had displays up telling people they did. Then the crackers started bouncing up and down in a strange order. I wanted the garlic and cheese ones. Monique said she had been fencing since she was 3, then 2 1/2. While she was measuring me, Jacob, and Patty, his wife, gave us a (illegible) about something confusing but it was supposed to be about love."

These guys were diving for a lid to a drink, and they had to pick it up with their mouths. Suddenly, my drama teacher was there and she made us turn around and not look as they dived for it so as not to embarrass them or something. That's what she does in the dance class during exams, when we have to make up a dance she makes everyone turn around so the person won't be embarrassed."

"I hardly remember anything so I'll just write about the bits I do remember. I remember looking for something and going up a hill to look for it and sliding back down it and slamming into a wall. I remember many houses along a street and the kids in the houses were falling in love with each other and sneaking through woods to see each other. I also remember a man who had been tricked into getting really mad, and while the town was in a circle having some kind of meeting, he lassoed them. And then he was never forgiven what he did. I think the person who tricked him was a woman. Soon the dream made more sense. I was racing through the woods with my younger sister and a whole bunch of other kids. Suddenly, I started moving my legs weirdly and I started to fly. Soon I had a balloon in one hand, my sister's hand in the other, two books under my arms, and I was flying above the treetops. I did not win the race but I did learn how to fly. When I got there, there was an adult who was surprised that I could lift off the ground with only two balloons (my sister was holding one). I also remember a poor family that lived in a big house that came from a warmer north."

I was in a jumper outfit (I hate jumpers) and I had this huge ball which I kept throwing in the air and I would go after it and fall over (I was a klutz). Then my sister came along and we skipped around. Then I was at this hotel in the woods and I walk around the side and it looks like our patio, except enlarged. There's a bench overlooking a creek. There's a full moon and my swim coach is on the bench whistling (he always whistles). That's all I remember."

"I was at My school but it didn't look like My school. Stuff happened that I can't remember. The me and a few other friends went to the classroom next to where were sleeping. It looked like classroom 2 at school, but had more stuff in it. My friend A. said that tequila tastes good with tortillas. I didn't find this at all strange. So we go into the classroom and ask if there are any tortillas. They say no but that there is pita bread, so we go in there and everyone else disappears. We look under the sink, which isn't in classroom 2 really, and underneath are big jugs (those square kind that cleaning stuff comes in) and they are kind of see-through and there is yellow-whitish liquid inside. On them they say something I don't remember. Anyway we pour the tequila into margarita glasses and eat it with pita bread. Some stuff happens. (I think that it has gotten later but I'm not sure.) An elderly black man comes in and says he has to check us. We immediately think he's talking about us drinking tequila. I'm the type who would break down and tell everything we were doing. I look, about to laugh at this black girl to my right (A.'s on my left). She put her long dark red nails in her mouth (a normal gesture as if biting her nails), and leans her head down and tells me no (don't tell). The man goes and checks behind a mirror inside a mirror like the illustration. Behind, there are some photos. Inside were the photos that showed the snake that bit one of the teachers. This was a big mystery, solved. Then we went away. I think later there was a big commotion with the teacher who had been bit."

Then there was this bell all over the city, like a school bell, which said summer vacation had started. Suddenly everyone was gone on vacation and I was still lost."

After I talked with him I went to find a place to sleep. I went up to the loft and I saw Diana holding on to the top of her rolled up sleeping bag when it was vertical.
